      <p>
       I've Studied Mechatronics Engineering at the Hashemite University and graduated in 2014, I worked as a Mechanical Design Enginner in Abu Dhabi for one year and then back to JORDAN to work as a Technical Engineer in electronics factory and quit the job in 2018, I always like to change my field to Software Development field but I was afraid to take the risk and when I heard about the advanced programming course in Abdul Aziz Al Ghurair School of Advanced Computing I register and take the decision.
